---------------------------------------------------------

- (Misc) Water direction now flows up if the crystal has spawned top, and flows down if the crystal spawned bottom.

==========================================   Patch 1.6.1   ===========================================================

- Quick hotfix where when a real player joined in VERY RARE CASES (this glitch only has happened once, and it was just now but I see how the function could break) it would replace the bot that was holding the crystal, which lead to players and bots not being able to pick up the Main Crystal, basically breaking the game.

==========================================   Patch 1.6   ===========================================================

---------------------New Additions-----------------------

- Skins have been added! Choose them from the class select menu! Simply press the arrows to cycle through skins.

- You can now spectate your team mates while you're dead! Simply left click while you are dead to cycle spectating through your team mates.

- Added rendering layers with abilities so that certain abilities always render on top of others. A problem for example was with Cleric heal covering up/hiding a lot of abilities.


-- Added new class: Water Queen

---------------------------------------------------------


------------------------Bug Fixes------------------------

- Fixed a bug where sometimes abilities weren't being removed on the client side randomly (so it'd appear to hit someone and just continue to go through them, even though damage etc was being dealt as normal).

- Fixed a bug where if a real player left through the escape menu hitting the leave game button instead of closing with the game windows X button, it took several seconds to actually disconnect them from the game.

- Fixed a bug with team placement where sometimes real players would be placed on the same team instead of the opposing team, sometimes resulting in one team being nothing but bots.

- Fixed another bug with the bots where instead of the game freezing (which was fixed in last hotfix patch) the game would lag for a little bit. (This actually only happened ONE TIME out of 15 games but I found the root of the problem so it shouldn't happen ever now).

- Fixed a bug with bots getting stuck on corners sometimes.

- Fixed a bug with bots attacking enemy sub crystals. If the enemy had more than 1 crystal captured, the bots would destroy a captured crystal, but continue attacking the destroyed crystal instead of repathing to the new holder that had a crystal in it.

---------------------------------------------------------


----------------------Misc Changes-----------------------

- Art changed for the castle walls and door entrance tiles.

- Water tiles changed, water now also has an animation.

- Flower generation has been turned down significantly. There will be less flowers now, it was a bit "cluttered" looking before and the less flowers compliments the new castle art pretty well.

---------------------------------------------------------

==========================================   Patch 1.5  ===========================================================

---------------------New Additions-----------------------

- Bots have been added! With this addition, there is now only a "Find Game" button. To play, simply click Find Game, if no games are available then you will automatically begin hosting one. 
(PLEASE NOTE, IF BITSIEGE IS UNABLE TO PORT FORWARD FOR YOU, AND YOU HAVE NOT MANUALLY PORT FORWARDED THE PORT 1331 (UDP), PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR GAME IF YOU BEGIN HOSTING ONE IN THE CASE NO OTHER GAMES ARE AVAILABLE!)

- Respawn locations are now a bit more spaced out.

- Fixed a bug where on some computers when players were stunned, they weren't appearing white as they should.

- Fixed crystal bug where if more than one person touched the crystal while it was destroyed, everyone touching it would get slowed as if they had the crystal, but only one person actually technically had the crystal.

- Health no longer will go below 0, this didn't effect gameplay but was more of a visual thing.

- Clerics Holy Restore now lasts only 6 seconds from 10.

- Clerics Holy Restore cooldown increased to 18 seconds from 16.



- Auto Portforwarding is now built right into BitSiege.jar. You will also now be notified right away if the auto portforward failed, so that you can take the proper steps to port forward if you wish to host games.



- There is now a class select screen instead of just the plain old nasty looking boring buttons.



- HUD now shows little bars on the left side of the screen that show allies class portrait as well as their health.



- Fixed a bug where if the game was extremely close, and you won as the other team reaches 100% progress, you would both win and lose.





==========================================   Patch 1.3.5.2  =============================================================



- Hotfix to Crystal fill up and decay bug. Teams points where being decayed even when they had crystals captured.



==========================================   Patch 1.3.5.1  =============================================================



- Added particle effect to Archers ultimate so you can now tell when the ability ends.



- "/capframes" now saves the setting in "bitsiege.properties" so you don't have to type it everytime.



- Frame rate cap now makes sure FPS doesn't drop below 60, on some machines uncapped frame rate was high (as it should be), but when the frame cap was turned on to save resources, the FPS would hang around 40-45, causing some noticeable choppiness sometimes. 



- Points needed to win in 1v1's and 2v2's has been lowered.



- Added visual point display inside of each teams progress bars at the bottom of the screen.





============================================   Patch 1.3.5 ==============================================================



- Patcher has been updated now to automatically update the game and install the new patch. This makes it a lot less annoying to receive new patches, and means I can put out smaller patches and hotfixes way more often whenever they are needed.



- If there is no update, it will automatically take you to the next menu, instead of having to click "Okay" to acknowledge there was no patch.



- Added an online user count to the Multiplayer Menus so you can see how many people are currently online. This shows all players online, in a game or not.



- Added a "/capframes" command. Simply type "/capframes" in the chat, and if your frame rate cap is ON, it will turn it OFF, and vice versa.



- Clerics ult now removes after 12 seconds but is still toggeable.





============================================   Patch 1.3.1.1 ============================================================



- Bug Fix to login systems.



============================================   Patch 1.3.1  =============================================================





- Added framerate cap, you can edit this in the "bitsiege.properties" file, just open it with any text editor to edit it. (There will be an options menu soon). If you wish to turn the framerate cap off, you can set "capframerate" to "no" from "yes". If you are unaware of what a framerate cap does, I simply don't let the FPS go above 60, which in turn makes Bit Siege use way less of your computers CPU resources. Framerate cap is ENABLED by default.



- You can now press Escape in game to exit the current game and go back to the main menu.



- Show Stats (P) is now toggleable.



- Fixed bug where chat would be extremely zoomed in, making it unreadable whenever the game would end, and in some other cases.



- Fixed Knights ultimate animation, the effect lasted as normal, but the yellow particle animation continued to play until the player died.





============================================   Patch 1.3  =============================================================



- New bases! Each base now has sub crystal rooms, the last map was to hard for the defending team to stop someone from destroying their sub crystal.



- Each teams "main crystal" has been removed. Instead, a progress bar for each team is now at the bottom of the screen. Team 0's bar is always on the left, and Team 1's bar is always on the right.



- Warmup mode has been added. You're no longer just trapped in your base waiting for enough players. Once there are enough players, everyones kills and deaths will reset, and all players will be taken back to their spawn point and the game will start.



- Camera now stays where you died until you respawn.



- Fixed a game breaking bug where sometimes when an ability was removed, it would crash the game.



- Fixed the spacebar locking issue once and for all, it no longer happens in any situation at all.



- Made the X marking the crystal on the map disappear if someone captures the crystal and there is no crystal currently spawned.



============================================   Patch 1.2  ==============================================================



- Added new class: Illusionist



Spell 1 - Spawn Clone: Spawns a clone on your current position that lasts for 30 seconds.

Cooldown: 4 seconds.



Spell 2 - Clone Attack: Sends all clones dashing out in their current facing direction dealing 40 damage and stunning the target for 1.5 seconds. Clones disappear after they hit a target.

Cooldown: 4 seconds.



Spell 3 - Swap Clone: Swaps your position with last placed clone. Swapped clone inherits your facing direction.

Cooldown: 9 seconds.



Spell 4 - For my next trick...: Spawns 4 clones around you that follow you for 20 seconds. They deal 20 damage each and stun for 2.5 seconds each.

Cooldown: 40 seconds.



- No longer have to restart the game and login again whenever a game ends.



- More network optimization.



- Fixed a bug in which if you joined a game already started, abilities that were casted BEFORE you joined were not appearing.



- Spell cooldowns now displayed at the top right of the spell tool tip.



- Scoreboard now shows how many crystals a player has captured.



- Clerics True Sight is now toggleable and no longer goes away after 12 seconds. Cast it again to turn it off.





============================================   Patch 1.1  ==============================================================



- Map now has a use!

Hold C to view the map and see where your teammates are 

and where the crystal last spawned. 



You can also see each teams Main Crystals progress bar!



If the crystal carrier is on your team, their name will be purple





- Major networking optimization was done, uses half the bandwidth.

- Fixed an issue with the spacebar sometimes locking direction even if you weren't holding it.

- Fixed names not being centered sometimes.

- Fixed a bug where capturing the crystal would sometimes crash the game
